Started coding with leaflet

# what is this
dated 25 Apr 2020, [demo](https://lsorling.github.io/leaflet_tests/test.htm)

## objectives:
wanted a standalone html file that can display tooltip just like the leaflet plugin: leaflet-tooltip-layout (auto space out tooltip)
BUT didnt want to run nodejs

## reference:
leaflet plugin: leaflet-tooltip-layout, see this: (https://github.com/ZijingPeng/leaflet-tooltip-layout)

## what's next?
* data is in file "data-geojson.js"
plan to auto generate other data into this file (follow this structure and variable name)
* host this set of files in a lightweight http server

## time spent
from 10am to 4pm
